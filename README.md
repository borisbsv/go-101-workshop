### Next steps

Congrats, you made it to the end of the workshop.
However, the material here is far from everything you can learn about Go.
If you want to continue learning Go here are some good next steps:

#### The rest of [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)

Complete the Tour of Go. Focus on the things we did not bring up here - interfaces, defers, named returns, etc.

#### [HTTP in Go](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)

Go is widely-used for web applications.
If you want to use it in that context, see what the standard library gives you for dealing with HTTP.

#### [Concurrency in Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency)

Go is made with concurrency in mind.
It provides powerful primitives that allow you to write concurrent code easily.

#### [Go modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules)

When using Go in the real-world, inevitably you will need to use some third-party package.
In Go this is done via Go modules.
You can get familiar with them in the link above.

#### [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)

A set of rules and pattern about how to write idiomatic and effective Go code.

#### [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

A great book about the language.
It starts from scratch and explains in-depth basic concepts and design decisions about the language.

#### [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

A set of code smells and common mistakes to look for when reviewing Go code..

#### [Go Time Podcast](https://changelog.com/gotime)

If you are a fan of podcasts Go Time is one of the best podcasts about Go.

#### [Golang Weekly Newsletter](https://golangweekly.com/)

Subsribe for weekly updates around the language and the community.
